## overview

Back in the Việt Nam...

I try to make a multiplayer online game for Bầu Cua. This game was so much fun when I was a kid, and I got hella bank from it. Dam, I still play it now every Tết (Lunar New Year).

## how to play

Basically, there are six items on the board (Deer, Squash, Chicken, Fish, Crab, Shrimp), and three dice are rolled. Each die has equal chance of being one of the six items. You place bets on what item you think the dice will show. Then you roll the die. For each dice that has your selected item(s), you get your money back plus whatever you bet. If the dice don't include your selected item(s), you lose the money you bet on those item(s).

EX: My brother put $20 bucks on the fish, and 3 fishes came up. That's $60 profit, bruther.

## dev notes

This game leads to gambling addiction. CHICKEN and SHRIMP for the win!!!

If I finish this, this will be my first multiplayer web application.

I love Việt Nam!!! Này Công Dân ơi, đứng lên đáp lời sông núi...
